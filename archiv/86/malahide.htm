<p><em>HERZLICH WILKOMMEN IN IRLAND</em></p>

<p>On April 6, fifteen students and their teacher Andreas Bauer
arrived from Prien-am-Chiemsee, Bavaria in Dubin Airport to spend
3 weeks learning English. They were hosted by parents of children
attending Pobalscoillosa, Malahide and St. Marys Baldoyle. The
day after their arrival</p>

<p>a reception was held in the library in Malahide Community
School for the visitors from Germany and for their Irish partners
and host parents. They were formally welcomed by Mrs. Bernie
Malaone Chairman of the Board of Management, Mr. Pat Callan
Acting Principal and by representatives from the Parents'
Committee. They were also entertained to Irish dancing by Audrey
Power, Kay McAdoo, Gemma Rinnce Maire NicAogain and even tried
and succeeded in doing the Walls of Limerick!</p>

<p>Guided tours were arranged for them of Malahide Castle, Hugh
Lane Gallery, National Art Gallery, National Museum and Dail
Eireann where they were received by local T.D. G.V. Wright. The
Host Parents in Malahide, Portmarnock and Raheny made them warmly
welcome and very much at home, and indeed brought them on Clarke,
Tracy Thornton and Angelina Ryan from Scoil sevaerl outings. </p>

<p>The kindness shown to the visitors was very much appreciate by
them and this was confirmed in the telephone call from Prien
immediately after their arrival back there. Their knowledge of
English greatly improved during the time here and likely long
lasting friendships between families in both countries will have
been formed. The Irish pupils now look forward to the return
visit on July 21st.</p>
